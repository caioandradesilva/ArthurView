# Maintenance Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive maintenance management system has been successfully integrated into the ADAM platform. This system supports the full maintenance lifecycle from request creation through work completion and verification, with role-based workflows for operators, admins, and clients.

## Firebase Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Collections

In Firebase Console > Firestore Database, create these collections:

1. **maintenanceTickets**
2. **maintenanceAttachments**
3. **maintenanceSchedules**
4. **maintenanceParts**
5. **maintenanceComments**
6. **maintenanceAuditEvents**

### Step 2: Create Counter Document

1. Navigate to the `counters` collection (or create it)
2. Create a document with ID: `maintenanceTicket`
3. Add field: `lastTicketNumber` (number) = `5000`

### Step 3: Update Security Rules

Add the security rules from `FIREBASE-MAINTENANCE-SCHEMA.md` to your Firestore Rules.

### Step 4: Set Up Firebase Storage

1. Enable Firebase Storage if not already enabled
2. Create the folder structure: `/maintenance-attachments/`
3. Apply the storage security rules from the schema document

### Step 5: Create Indexes

Indexes will be created automatically as you use the app. Firebase will provide links in the console when an index is needed.

Required composite indexes:
- `maintenanceTickets`: `siteId` + `status` + `createdAt`
- `maintenanceTickets`: `assignedTo` (array) + `status` + `createdAt`
- `maintenanceTickets`: `maintenanceType` + `status` + `scheduledDate`
- `maintenanceAttachments`: `maintenanceTicketId` + `category` + `createdAt`
- `maintenanceSchedules`: `isActive` + `nextScheduledDate`
- `maintenanceComments`: `maintenanceTicketId` + `createdAt`
- `maintenanceAuditEvents`: `maintenanceTicketId` + `createdAt`

## Success Metrics

Once fully implemented, measure success by:
- Average maintenance completion time
- Percentage of preventive vs corrective maintenance
- Operator response times
- Asset downtime reduction
- Maintenance cost trends
- Parts inventory accuracy
- Client satisfaction scores

## Support & Questions

For implementation questions or issues:
1. Review the Firebase schema document for database structure
2. Check type definitions for data models
3. Examine existing pages for implementation patterns
4. Test with sample data before production use

The foundation is solid and ready for the remaining features to be built on top of it.
